ü´ô **[Cloudbreak Tip Jar](https://buy.stripe.com/00w5kDfcB0tcbw7bok0Ba0q)** ü™ô

This is the official community hub for users of all [CloudBreak.app](https://cloudbreak.app/) products. This space, powered by GitHub Discussions and Issues, is designed for you to connect with other users, ask for help, share your projects, and propose ideas.

## What is this space for?

* **‚ùì Get Help:** Ask questions and get answers from the community.
* **üí° Share Ideas:** Share tips, tricks, and best practices you've discovered.
* **üí¨ General Discussion:** Chat about new features, industry news, or anything else related to the [CloudBreak.app](https://cloudbreak.app/) ecosystem.
* **üöÄ Show and Tell:** Showcase the amazing things you're building with our tools!

## Our Support Policy: Please Read

To keep our products affordable, we do not offer free, one-on-one technical support. This forum is the primary way to get help, and it relies on **peer-to-peer (user-to-user) assistance**.

* This is **not** an official support channel with guaranteed response times.
* The user community, not the [CloudBreak.app](https://cloudbreak.app/) team, is the first line of support here.
* Please be respectful and patient. Everyone here is helping in their spare time.

## Team Engagement & The Tip Jar

While our official policy is community-led support, members of the [CloudBreak.app](https://cloudbreak.app/) team are passionate about serving our users and will often browse these forums.

If a team member provides exceptional help that saves you significant time or solves a critical problem (or you just like what we do), you can show your appreciation through our tip jar. This helps us justify spending more time here helping the community directly.

‚û°Ô∏è **[Say Thanks via the CloudBreak Tip Jar](https://buy.stripe.com/00w5kDfcB0tcbw7bok0Ba0q)**

*Please note: Tipping is entirely optional and is a way to say "thank you" for help that goes above and beyond. It is not an entitlement for priority support.*

## Code of Conduct

To ensure this remains a welcoming and productive environment, please adhere to a few simple rules:

1.  **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with kindness and respect. No harassment or insults.
2.  **Be Clear:** When asking a question, provide as much context as possible (e.g., error messages, what you've already tried, relevant code snippets).
3.  **Be Helpful:** If you know the answer to someone's question, don't be afraid to jump in!
4.  **Stay On Topic:** Keep discussions relevant to the [CloudBreak.app](https://cloudbreak.app/) ecosystem.
